          My coding journey began not in a classroom, but in my room — just a
          spark of interest and the drive to figure things out. From simple HTML
          pages to full-stack applications, every line of code I wrote opened a
          new door.
        </p>

        <p>
          I wasn’t just learning to build apps — I was learning how to think,
          solve, and create. I explored frontend frameworks, backend systems,
          databases, design, and even a bit of AI. Curiosity became consistency,
          and consistency brought growth.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now, I don’t just want to build things alone. I want to collaborate —
          with individuals, teams, and organizations. I believe that true
          innovation happens when great minds come together to solve real
          problems.
        </p>

        <p>
          My mission is to build solutions that help others while also growing
          my own skills, network, and opportunities. Whether it’s a startup
          needing an MVP or a nonprofit needing a system — I want to contribute,
          learn, and evolve through every challenge.
        </p>

        <p>
          This journey is just getting started. And I’m not just coding to code
          — I’m coding to create impact, to connect with amazing people, and to
          build a future where technology solves problems that actually matter.
