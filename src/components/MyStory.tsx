          My coding journey began not in a classroom, but in my room — just a
          spark of interest and the drive to figure things out. From simple HTML
          pages to full-stack applications, every line of code I wrote opened a
          new door.
        </p>

        <p>
          I wasn&apos;t just learning to build apps — I was learning how to
          think, solve, and create. I explored frontend frameworks, backend
          systems, databases, design, and even a bit of AI. Curiosity became
          consistency, and consistency brought growth.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now, I don&apos;t just want to build things alone. I want to
          collaborate — with individuals, teams, and organizations. I believe
          that true innovation happens when great minds come together to solve
          real problems.
        </p>

        <p>
          My mission is to build solutions that help others while also growing
          my own skills, network, and opportunities. Whether it&apos;s a startup
          needing an MVP or a nonprofit needing a system — I want to contribute,
          learn, and evolve through every challenge.
        </p>

        <p>
          This journey is just getting started. And I&apos;m not just coding to
          code — I&apos;m coding to create impact, to connect with amazing
          people, and to build a future where technology solves problems that
          actually matter. 🌍💻
